"""Truncate a recording to start at its first fastlio_odometry message.

Everything timestamped before the first `fastlio_odometry` sample is dropped:
  - .db: deleted from every stream (the data, `_blob` and `_rtree` tables),
  - .rrd: rebuilt from the truncated db, so it starts exactly at t0 (rebuilding
    avoids the timeline-boundary float imprecision of `rerun rrd split`, and the
    aggregated maps/paths only reflect the post-t0 data).

The db edit is in place; deleting rows doesn't shrink the file (SQLite reuses
free pages) but the dropped prefix is tiny.

    uv run python dimos/mapping/recording/utils/trunc.py REC/mem2.db [REC/main.rrd]
