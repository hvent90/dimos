"""Blueprint: PointLio fed by a VirtualMid360 replaying a recorded pcap.

VirtualMid360 stands up a fake Mid-360 on a virtual NIC and replays the pcap
over the Livox wire protocol; PointLio connects to it exactly as it would to
real hardware (no replay_pcap — it runs in live SDK mode and never knows the
sensor is synthetic). Use this to re-run a recorded session through the live
SLAM path, e.g. to confirm a clip does not diverge.

The two talk over UDP on lidar_ip/host_ip, so they need a network where those
IPs are reachable (the e2e harness runs VirtualMid360 in a `lidar` netns and
PointLio in a `drv` netns joined by a veth carrying lidar_ip).
