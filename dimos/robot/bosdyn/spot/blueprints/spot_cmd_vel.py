"""Boston Dynamics Spot keyboard teleop + full sensor streaming with a Rerun viewer.

Pygame keyboard -> Twist on `cmd_vel` -> SpotHighLevel -> robot. The same module
streams the five fisheye + five depth cameras and body odometry. A Rerun bridge
spawns the viewer. WASD to move/turn, QE to strafe, Space for e-stop, ESC to quit.

The ip auto-detects: with no `-o spothighlevel.ip=` given, it probes Spot's WiFi
AP address (192.168.80.3) then the Ethernet address (10.0.0.3) and uses
whichever answers.

Usage:
    dimos run spot \
        -o spothighlevel.username=admin -o spothighlevel.password=<password>
    # or force an address:
    dimos run spot ... -o spothighlevel.ip=10.0.0.3
