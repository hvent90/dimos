"""Replay the latest Spot recording to Rerun — no robot, runs anywhere.

`SpotReplay` plays a memory2 recording (from `spot-record`) back onto the same
stream names `SpotHighLevel` uses, so the Spot camera layout and per-camera
frustums light up in the Rerun 3D view. The `visual_override` routes the two
shared CameraInfo streams onto each camera's image entity so every frustum
anchors to its optical frame.

Usage:
    # newest *.db under ~/datasets/spot:
    dimos run spot-replay
    # a specific recording:
    dimos run spot-replay -o spotreplay.db_path=/path/to/spot.db
