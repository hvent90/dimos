"""Longest clear heading from a point — VQA over the go2 replays.

Rows (``go2_pointcloud_free_range_vqa.json``) are pure data emitted by
:func:`rows` — ground truth ray-marched on the full-resolution cloud,
quizzing whatever lossy encoding the agent receives for a ``PointCloud2``.

The task is a robot's: which way is it most open, if any. From a point, the
agent picks the compass heading it could travel furthest along over floor the
lidar mapped and found nothing standing on above 0.15 m — or answers that no
heading is clear that far, when the point is boxed in. Ten rows, five with a
clear heading and five without; the prompt does not say which, and a heading
that merely points into the window's corner cannot win because every heading
is capped at the distance to the nearest edge of the mapped cloud.

Ten hand-picked rows, tagged ``train``: too few to hold a group-disjoint
holdout, so like the hand-authored families they are not sliced. The 0.15 m
edge is the eval's, stated in the prompt; the encoder never sees it.

Regenerate (needs the three recordings)::
