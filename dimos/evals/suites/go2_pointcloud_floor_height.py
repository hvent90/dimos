"""Off-level floor near the robot — VQA over the go2 replays.

Rows (``go2_pointcloud_floor_height_vqa.json``) are pure data emitted by
:func:`rows` — ground truth read off the full-resolution cloud, quizzing
whatever lossy encoding the agent receives for a ``PointCloud2``.

The task: is any floor within a few meters of the robot at a different level
than the floor it stands on — raised or sunken — and if so, where and by how
much. Ten rows, five with a real step or drop and five where the floor is one
level; the prompt does not say which. The answer locates each off-level area
and its height offset, or is ``level``.

``go2_stairs_20260819`` carries the raised area the hand-authored floor rows
label; the frames here are the moving stretches around them.
``go2_teleop_20260819`` is absent — its map has a false depression from the
robot being carried before recording.

Ten hand-picked rows, tagged ``train``: too few to slice.

Regenerate (needs the recordings)::
