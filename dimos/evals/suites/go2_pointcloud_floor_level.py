"""Floor-level VQA over the go2 stairs replay.

Is the floor all at one level, or is part of it raised or sunken? An
open-ended answer — a set of places and, for each, how far off the main floor
it sits — scored by :func:`~dimos.evals.scorers.matched_set` at a 1.2 m radius
with a 0.15 m band on the offset, so finding the right place at the wrong
height earns partial credit.

This suite shares its six frames with
:mod:`dimos.evals.suites.go2_pointcloud_stairs`, which asks a different
question of them: not "is anything at a different level" but "are there
steps". The gap between the two scores is the point — it separates an encoding
that carries elevation from one that carries structure. Keep them separate so
they can be run and reported independently.

The labels are **hand-authored** against the recording. Three frames see the
raised area, three do not. ``go2_teleop_20260819`` is deliberately absent: its
map contains a ~15 m^2 false depression from the robot being carried before
the recording started, so it cannot be used for anything about floor height.

Regenerate the context windows (needs the recording; keeps the labels)::

    python -m dimos.evals.suites.go2_pointcloud_floor_level
