"""Room-count VQA over fused go2 maps.

The first suite whose context selector *fuses*: instead of showing the model
``context_budget`` snapshots of a rolling local map, the window is thinned to
every 6th frame and accumulated into one voxel map (``emit_every=0`` yields a
single observation, at the end). The question is about the shape of a whole
mapped stretch, which no single sweep carries.

Counting rooms is deliberately structural — two areas count as separate only
when a doorway-width opening is the only way between them — so the answer turns
on whether the encoding preserves the pinch between them at all.

The labels are **hand-authored** against the recordings. Scored with
``within(1.0)`` on the parsed number, so off-by-one earns nothing but is not
punished past zero.

No window may span t ~ 1200-1440 s in the agentic recording: that is the
relocalisation, and fusing across it smears the one doorway into two.
``go2_teleop_20260819`` appears here and nowhere else — its map has a ~15 m^2
false depression from the robot being carried before the recording started, so
it must never be used for anything about floor height.

Regenerate (needs both recordings; keeps the labels)::
