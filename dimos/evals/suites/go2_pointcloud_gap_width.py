"""Gap between things you could pass through — VQA over the go2 replays.

Rows (``go2_pointcloud_gap_width_vqa.json``) are pure data emitted by
:func:`rows` — ground truth by single-linkage grouping of the
full-resolution returns, quizzing whatever lossy encoding the agent receives
for a ``PointCloud2``.

The task: near a point, are there two or more separate things standing above
the floor with a gap between them — the kind of gap a robot picks its way
through? If so, where is the narrowest gap and how wide is it. Ten rows, five
with two or more separate things and five with at most one; the prompt does
not say which. The answer locates the narrowest gap and its width, or is
``none``.

Ten hand-picked rows, tagged ``train``: too few to slice.

Regenerate (needs the three recordings)::
