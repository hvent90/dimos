"""Path-to-goal VQA over the go2 replays, in sensing terms.

Rows (``go2_pointcloud_route_vqa.json``) are pure data emitted by
:func:`rows` — ground truth a flood fill over the full-resolution cloud,
quizzing whatever lossy encoding the agent receives for a ``PointCloud2``.

``route`` asks whether a goal 3 m out can be reached along some path across
the floor, and what that path has to cross. Three answers, all defined by
what the lidar measured: ``measured`` if a path exists through cells that
were swept and hold nothing above 0.15 m; ``unmeasured`` if every path has to
cross cells with no return at all; ``blocked`` if no path exists even
counting unmeasured cells as passable. The 0.15 m edge and the 0.2 m margin
are this question's definitions, stated in the prompt; the encoder carries
neither.

Earlier this family's truth came from the navigation stack's planner and its
answers were ``reachable`` / ``unknown`` / ``blocked`` — words that ask the
encoder to be a planner. The frames and goals are unchanged; the truth is
now the sensing definition above, and 10 of 36 answers moved with it.
