"""Doorway-spotting VQA over the go2 agentic replay.

Open-ended, unlike the multiple-choice pointcloud families: the model is asked
whether it can see a doorway and, if so, where — so a reply is a set of points,
not a word from a list. Scored by
:func:`~dimos.evals.scorers.matched_set` at a 0.8 m radius, which charges for
both a missed doorway and an invented one. There is nothing to guess: a blind
model has no way to name a coordinate, which is what makes the blind ablation
the honest floor here.

The labels are **hand-authored** against the recording, one frame at a time.
Three frames see the doorway, three do not.

``_LABELS`` carries two different coordinates for what is physically the same
doorway. That is not a typo. The map relocalises between t ~ 1116 s and
t ~ 1440 s — a 0.65 m x / 0.27 m y shift — and the gap was measured
independently in each frame's own coordinates. Labels are per-frame; never
substitute one for the other.

Regenerate the context windows (needs the recording; keeps the labels)::

    python -m dimos.evals.suites.go2_pointcloud_doorway
