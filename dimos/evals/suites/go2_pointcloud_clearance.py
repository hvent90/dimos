"""Corridor clearance VQA over the go2 replays.

Rows (``go2_pointcloud_clearance_vqa.json``) are pure data emitted by
:func:`rows` — ground truth computed analytically from full-resolution clouds
plus odom, quizzing whatever lossy encoding the agent receives for a
``PointCloud2``.

``clearance`` asks whether a 0.6 m x 2 m corridor at body height is
obstructed. Two-valued on purpose: at 2 m the lidar has swept everywhere
around the robot, so silence really does mean empty. Unmeasured space is a
real question, but it needs a goal far enough out to reach it — that belongs
to :mod:`dimos.evals.suites.go2_pointcloud_route`.
