"""Room to set something down — VQA over the go2 replays.

Rows (``go2_pointcloud_free_disk_vqa.json``) are pure data emitted by
:func:`rows` — ground truth from a distance transform over the
full-resolution cloud, quizzing whatever lossy encoding the agent receives
for a ``PointCloud2``.

The task: the robot needs a clear open spot near a point to set down what it
carries. Is there a patch of floor the lidar mapped and found nothing on
(above 0.15 m) large enough for a circle at least 1.8 m across, within about
2.5 m of the point? If so, where is the centre of the largest such spot. Ten
rows, five with a spot and five without; the prompt does not say which. The
reasoning it forces is the round's whole thesis: floor the sensor never swept
cannot be a place to set something down, so it does not count.

Ten hand-picked rows, tagged ``train``: too few to slice.

Regenerate (needs the three recordings)::
