"""Unexplored space: reachable or walled off — VQA over the go2 replays.

Rows (``go2_pointcloud_frontier_vqa.json``) are pure data emitted by
:func:`rows` — ground truth by flood fill over the full-resolution cloud,
quizzing whatever lossy encoding the agent receives for a ``PointCloud2``.

The task is an exploring robot's: the lidar returned nothing from a spot, so
it is unmapped — but is it unmapped because it is *open floor you have not
driven to yet* (a place worth exploring), or because it is *behind a wall or
inside something solid* (nowhere you could go)? The agent reasons from the
mapped floor and obstacles whether an open path leads to the spot. Ten train
rows, five reachable and five walled off, plus a small holdout; the prompt
says the spot is unmapped but never which kind it is.

This is the round's thesis at its plainest: telling swept-empty floor from
never-measured space, and reasoning about which side of an obstacle the
unmeasured space lies on.
