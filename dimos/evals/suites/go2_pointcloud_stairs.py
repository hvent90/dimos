"""Stair-spotting VQA over the go2 stairs replay.

Are there stairs or steps in view, and if so where, and how far do they rise?
An open-ended answer scored by :func:`~dimos.evals.scorers.matched_set` at a
1.2 m radius with a 0.15 m band on the rise.

Deliberately the same six frames as
:mod:`dimos.evals.suites.go2_pointcloud_floor_level`, asked differently. That
suite asks whether any part of the floor sits at a different level; this one
asks whether there are *steps*. An encoding can carry elevation — a patch of
floor is higher over there — without carrying the structure that makes it a
staircase, and the gap between the two suites' scores is exactly that
difference. Keep them separate so they can be run and reported independently.

The labels are **hand-authored** against the recording. Three frames see the
steps, three do not.

Regenerate the context windows (needs the recording; keeps the labels)::

    python -m dimos.evals.suites.go2_pointcloud_stairs
