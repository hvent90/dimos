"""Per-case pass/fail diff between two report JSONs.

The aggregate score can rise while individual cases flip from pass to fail.
Diffing two reports names every flip, so a change is judged case by case
rather than by the average alone. Stateless: which report counts as the
baseline is the caller's decision, typically the last kept run.
