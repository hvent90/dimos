# R1 Lite Bring-up Log (living lab notebook)

Verbose, dated evidence trail of the R1 Lite dimos integration. Append-only:
new findings get new dated entries; earlier observations are never rewritten
(if one turns out wrong, a later entry says so and why). At the end of the
integration this gets distilled into a polished README in the style of
[`scripts/r1pro_test/README.md`](../r1pro_test/README.md).

Branch: `krishna/task/r1lite-integration` (stacked on
`mustafa/task/r1pro-coordinator-integration`, tip `9ab0ab318`; main was 204
commits ahead of the shared base at branch time — Mustafa nudged to rebase).

---

## 2026-07-02 — Day 1: discovery, environment, credentials, first recon

### 1. Finding the robot (the hard way, then the surprise)

**Hypothesis:** R1 Lite ships like the R1 Pro — ethernet at `192.168.2.150`
(factory) or no IPv4 at all.

**Tests & findings:**
- Laptop `enp130s0` was `NO-CARRIER` until cable plugged (check:
  `cat /sys/class/net/enp130s0/carrier`).
- Added runtime IPs to laptop without touching the saved "lidar" profile:
  `nmcli device modify enp130s0 +ipv4.addresses 192.168.2.100/24 +ipv4.addresses 192.168.123.100/24`
  (runtime-only — reverts on reconnect; saved profile keeps only 192.168.1.5).
- Pings to `.2.150` / `.123.150`: nothing.
- **IPv6 all-nodes multicast ping** (`ping -6 ff02::1%enp130s0`): one foreign
  responder, `fe80::c68f:8fbd:376b:a2`, MAC `e0:51:d8:1f:04:75` — works
  because every UP interface always has a link-local IPv6 even with zero
  IPv4 config. This is the no-sudo substitute for Mustafa's tcpdump trick.
- Ping sweep of 192.168.{1,2,123}.0/24 + `ip neigh`: `192.168.1.85`
  answered with the SAME MAC → device found. `nmap -sV`: hostname
  **`r1lite`**, OpenSSH 8.9p1 (Ubuntu 22.04), only port 22 open.
- **Gotcha (ARP flux):** laptop had TWO interfaces on 192.168.1.0/24 (wifi
  .110 + eth .5), and `.85` later turned out reachable only via WIFI. The
  robot answered ARP for its *wifi* address out its *ethernet* port.
  Resolved identity definitively by comparing SSH host keys over both paths
  (`ssh-keyscan 192.168.1.85` vs `ssh-keyscan fe80::...%enp130s0`) —
  **identical ed25519 key → same machine on both paths.**

**Conclusion:** direct cable to robot confirmed; robot also on office wifi
at `192.168.1.85` (someone provisioned it — non-factory state); ethernet
port *appeared* to have no IPv4 (see §5 for the correction).

### 2. Laptop environment (docker + py3.10)

- ghcr pulls needed `read:packages` on the gh token
  (`gh auth refresh -h github.com -s read:packages`).
- **Wrong-image trap:** compose file `docker/dev/docker-compose.yaml` uses
  `ghcr.io/dimensionalos/dev:latest` — that's the NON-ROS track (no
  `/opt/ros`). The ROS-track image is **`ghcr.io/dimensionalos/ros-dev:dev`**
  (what `bin/dev` uses). Launched manually:
  `docker run -d --name dimos-dev-r1lite --network host -v <repo>:/app ... ros-dev:dev`
- `/app/.venv` was the host's py3.12 venv (bind mount!) → interpreter
  doesn't exist in container. Rebuilt per Mustafa §12.A:
  `rm -rf .venv && UV_PYTHON=3.10 uv sync --all-extras --no-extra dds --no-extra unitree-dds`
  → `rclpy OK`, `dimos OK`. `.envrc → .envrc.r1pro` symlinked.
- ROS 2 domain sweep 0–101 from container (scanner now at
  `scripts/r1lite_test/domain_scan.py`): **zero foreign participants** —
  robot stack simply not running (confirmed later, §5).

### 3. Credentials saga

**Hypothesis:** Galaxea default `nvidia`/`nvidia` (all their docs say so).

**Tests:** 3 manual + scripted attempts as `nvidia@192.168.1.85` → all
`Permission denied`. Web docs (R1/R1 Lite/R1 Pro) all confirm nvidia/nvidia
as factory default → concluded unit was re-provisioned.

**Resolution:** actual login is user **`r1lite`** (robot's own hostname as
username), password obtained from [fill in: who/where]. Factory docs were
wrong for this unit because it's NOT the documented Orin config (see §5).
Key auth installed via `ssh-copy-id`; laptop `~/.ssh/config` has alias
`r1lite` → `r1lite@192.168.1.85`. Robot's `last` showed a login
2026-05-22 from `192.168.1.105` (the provisioner's machine, presumably).

### 4. Branch & scaffolding

- `krishna/task/r1lite-integration` branched off Mustafa's branch tip,
  tracking it (plain `git pull` follows his pushes). Strategy: stay
  additive, sync often, never edit his r1pro files here.
- `scripts/r1lite_test/` scaffolding ported from `r1pro_test/`:
  `r1lite_config.py` (single source of truth, `TODO(recon)` markers),
  `test_00_recon.py` (new — graph dump), `test_01..04,06` (parameterized,
  arm tests adapt DOF from live feedback), `run_all_tests.py`,
  `domain_scan.py`, `README.md`. All syntax-checked in container.
  Uncommitted pending hardware reconciliation.

### 5. First SSH recon — most prior assumptions overturned

Ran read-only identity/env recon over SSH. Findings:

| Assumed (from R1 Pro) | Actual (R1 Lite unit) |
|---|---|
| Jetson Orin, aarch64 | **x86_64 PC**, Ubuntu 22.04.5 |
| user `nvidia` | user **`r1lite`** |
| eth has no IPv4 | **eth `enp2s0` = `10.42.0.2/24`** (we only probed 192.168.x!) |
| ROS_DOMAIN_ID=41 | **`ROS_DOMAIN_ID=02`** (bashrc; note the string "02") |
| maybe ROS 1 | **ROS 2 Humble installed** — no upgrade needed |

More robot-side facts (from `~/.bashrc`, `ls ~`):
- `ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=0`, `ROS_IP=10.42.0.2` → robot pre-configured to
  talk ROS over the ethernet cable; laptop just needs a `10.42.0.x` addr.
  Mustafa's netplan step is NOT needed on this unit.
- Home dir: `can.sh`, `setup_can.sh`, `can.txt`, `first_start`, `lite`,
  `galaxea/install/`, `GalaxeaDataset`, `realtime_tools`, `test`,
  `findrobot_{server,client}.sh`, **`fastdds_unicast.xml`**,
  **`super_client_configuration_file.xml`** (DDS discovery-server/unicast
  configs — check whether launches depend on them before assuming
  multicast discovery works).
- `can0` interface DOWN; no ros/hdas/mobiman processes → stack fully idle.
  Explains the empty domain sweep in §2.

**Open questions carried forward:**
1. What do `first_start`, `lite`, `can.txt`, the findrobot scripts do?
2. Does the stack launch depend on the FastDDS XML configs (unicast /
   discovery server), and do we need matching client config in the container?
3. Topic names/types vs R1 Pro `/hdas/*` + `/motion_target/*` (test_00).
4. Arm/torso DOF (expected 6/4), torso safe home pose.
5. Chassis 3-gate problem present on R1 Lite's chassis node?
6. Camera/lidar inventory.

**Next session plan (agreed division of labor):** Krishna drives all
state-changing robot commands from a Cursor Remote-SSH window ("Console A");
Claude runs read-only SSH recon + laptop/container work. Steps: laptop
`10.42.0.100/24` → read startup scripts → Krishna starts CAN+stack →
`test_00_recon` from container on domain 2 → reconcile `r1lite_config.py`.

### 6. Startup-machinery recon complete (read-only pass over SSH)

**The password mystery, solved for real:** Galaxea's own `findrobot_server.sh`
hardcodes per-model credentials: `R1-LITE) passwd="1"`, `R1-PRO) passwd="nvidia"`.
And `can.sh`/`sessions.sh` do `echo "1" | sudo -S ...` throughout. So **R1 Lite
factory login = user `r1lite` / password `1`** — the unit was never
re-provisioned; the public docs just only cover the Orin models. (The office
wifi join was still done by someone — login 2026-05-22 from 192.168.1.105.)

**Hardware identity** (`/opt/galaxea/body/hardware.json`): R1-LITE with
ARM=A1X, TORSO=T0, ECU=E03, CHASSIS=C1 (+CS1 steering sw), ARM_END=EE0,
HEAD_CAMERA=HC0, WRIST_CAMERA=WC1. Compare R1 Pro: chassis W1 3-wheel swerve.

**DDS mode — multicast confirmed, three ways:**
- `.bashrc`: `ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER` and `FASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE` lines
  are COMMENTED OUT; active: `ROS_DOMAIN_ID=02`, `ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=0`,
  `ROS_IP=10.42.0.2`.
- No listener on port 11811 while idle.
- `prestart_prepare.sh` / `r1lite_prestart_prepare.sh` (sourced by every
  module start script) set only paths/setup.bash — no DDS env.
- Caveat: the boot profile DOES start `fastdds discovery -p 11811`
  (ros2_discovery.yaml) but nothing points at it — vestigial. The
  `findrobot_server.sh` script would switch the robot INTO discovery-server
  mode (rewrites bashrc + reboots) — do NOT run it.

**Boot machinery decoded:**
- Entry point: `robot_startup.sh boot <sessions.d-profile-dir>` → tmuxp loads
  every `*.yaml` in the profile dir; `robot_startup.sh kill` = tmux
  kill-server + ros2 daemon stop. Writes profile name to /tmp/start_type.log
  (currently absent → nothing booted since reboot).
- Profiles under `sessions.d/`: ATCStandard + ATCSystem both have
  **`R1LITEBody.d`** (mobiman.yaml identical; teleop/system differ only
  cosmetically). Also R1LITEVRTeleop.d, R1LITEVRATC.d, ATCHostStandard/R1LITET.d.
- **`R1LITEBody.d` contents** (tmux sessions → commands):
  - `hdas`: `start_hdas_r1lite.sh` = CAN bringup (down/up can0, CAN-FD 1M/5M)
    + `ros2 launch HDAS r1lite.py`; second window: head camera + realsense
    wrist cameras.
  - `mobiman`: chassis (`r1_lite_chassis_control_w_o_eepose_launch.py`),
    torso speed control (R1LITE arg), gripper controller (R1LITE),
    ee_pose, jointTrackerdemo_fast, relaxed_ik left+right.
  - `ros_discovery`: vestigial fastdds discovery server.
  - `system`: system_manager + robot_monitor.
  - `teleop`: **`start_r1lite_tabletop_gello_teleop.sh`** — GELLO leader-arm
    teleop; will try to own the arms. Kill this session after boot unless
    the GELLO rig is attached (likely fails w/o hardware, but don't risk it).
  - `tools`: data_collection + monitors.
- `can.txt` = old candump debug capture (the 175KB "dump of shit"); `~/lite/`
  = stereo calibration artifacts (Chinese dirnames); both ignorable.
- Workspace `~/galaxea/install/` includes full OCS2 MPC stack
  (ocs2_mobile_manipulator etc.), livox_ros_driver2, greenwave_monitor —
  richer than expected; relaxed_ik + jointTracker are the arm command paths.
- Quirk: prestart scripts hardcode `/home/nvidia/galaxea/maps` for MAP_DIR —
  copied from Orin models, harmless for us.

**Agreed boot command for step 3 (Krishna, Console A):**
```bash
cd ~/galaxea/install/startup_config/share/startup_config/script
./robot_startup.sh boot ../sessions.d/ATCStandard/R1LITEBody.d
# wait ~30-60s, then: tmux ls  (expect: hdas, mobiman, ros_discovery, system, r1lite_teleop, tools)
tmux kill-session -t r1lite_teleop   # keep GELLO teleop off the arms
# stop everything later with: ./robot_startup.sh kill
```

## 2026-07-03 — Day 2: stack boot + full topic recon (FIRST CONTACT)

**Boot:** Krishna ran `robot_startup.sh boot ../sessions.d/ATCStandard/R1LITEBody.d`
(Console A). Arms/grippers twitched on HDAS init (expected health sign).
6 tmux sessions up (hdas, mobiman, r1lite_teleop, ros_discovery, system,
tools), 31 ROS processes. GELLO teleop session killed after boot.

**Laptop wiring:** `nmcli device modify enp130s0 +ipv4.addresses 10.42.0.100/24`
→ ping 10.42.0.2 at ~0.4ms over cable. Container on ROS_DOMAIN_ID=2 sees
the full graph via plain multicast — NO XML/discovery-server config needed.

**test_00_recon results (132 topics, 29 nodes):**

| Segment | Feedback topic | DOF | Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| arm left/right | /hdas/feedback_arm_* | **6 each** | 200 Hz |
| torso | /hdas/feedback_torso | **4** | **488 Hz** |
| chassis | /hdas/feedback_chassis | 3 | 200 Hz |
| gripper l/r | /hdas/feedback_gripper_* | **1 each** | 200 Hz |
| aggregate | /joint_states | 25 (?) | 500 Hz |
| hands | /hdas/feedback_hand_* | silent | 0 Hz (not fitted) |

Upper body = 4+6+6 = **16 joints** (R1 Pro: 18). MotorCommandArray slicing
for the connection module: torso 0-3, left 4-9, right 10-15 (+ grippers
handled separately via target_position_gripper_*).

**Command topics confirmed subs>0:** target_joint_state_{arm_left,arm_right,
torso}, target_position_gripper_*, target_speed_chassis, target_speed_torso
(TwistStamped — new vs R1 Pro), brake_mode, chassis_acc_limit. The
`target_joint_state_arm_*` pubs=1 scare resolved: jointTracker holds idle
publishers (0 Hz) — no contention.

**Chassis gate suspects all present:** /controller (hdas_msg/
ControllerSignalStamped, pubs=1 subs=1), brake_mode + chassis_acc_limit
(subs=1 each), /motion_control/chassis_speed (pubs=1). NOTE: R1 Pro's
gatekeeper /cmd_vel topic does NOT exist — command path is
target_speed_chassis directly. Whether the 3-gate unlock ritual is needed
is test_03's job.

**Perception inventory (differs a lot from R1 Pro):** wrist L/R = full
RealSense stacks (color + depth + aligned + pointcloud + compressed).
Head = STEREO RGB pair (left_raw/right_raw compressed) with NO depth topic
(calib/head_left+right camera_info suggest stereo depth is computed
elsewhere/offline). NO chassis cameras. NO lidar topic (livox_ros_driver2
installed but not in R1LITEBody profile). /robot_description published
(pubs=2) → URDF obtainable straight off the topic. TF + tf_static live.

**Extras noticed:** /hdas/feedback_*_arm_wrench (force/torque!), /hdas/bms,
per-ECU version topics, relaxed_ik EE-pose command path, system_manager
manipulation/navi action servers, /vla/prompt_echo (VLA hooks), OCS2 stack
in workspace. R1 Lite is teleop/data-collection oriented out of the box.

**Config reconciled:** r1lite_config.py updated with all verified values;
EXPECTED_TOPICS now 12 topics incl. grippers + IMUs. Remaining TODO(recon):
joint names per topic, torso home pose, chassis gating behavior, head-depth
story, lidar presence.

### Day 2 continued — fill-ins + test_01 PASS

- **Joint names:** HDAS feedback topics carry placeholder names
  (`['left_arm']`, `['torso']`, ...) — ordering by convention, like R1 Pro.
  `/joint_states` (25 joints) gives the real naming: steer_motor_joint1-3 +
  wheel_motor_joint1-3 (**3-wheel swerve**, C1 ≈ W1 family), torso_joint1-3,
  {left,right}_arm_joint1-6, {left,right}_gripper_finger_joint1-2.
- **URDF captured** → `scripts/r1lite_test/r1lite_from_robot.urdf` (44KB,
  33 joint tags). Meshes referenced as
  `package://mobiman/urdf/R1_Lite/meshes/*.STL` → live on robot at
  `~/galaxea/install/mobiman/share/mobiman/urdf/R1_Lite/meshes/` — scp later
  for data/r1_lite_description. Wrist cams = **D405** (same as R1 Pro);
  link naming mirrors R1 Pro conventions.
- **Torso 3-vs-4 discrepancy:** URDF has only torso_joint1-3, but
  /hdas/feedback_torso streams 4 values @ 488 Hz. Suspect coupled/parallel
  lift motors. Command-side expectation TBD from torso start script /
  test_06 — treat torso command DOF as OPEN until verified.
- **"A message was lost!!!" spam** during `ros2 topic echo` on 200-488 Hz
  topics = Python CLI subscriber too slow, benign. Watch for the same
  symptom in the dimos connection later though (Mustafa's sensor-drop
  class of problem).
- **test_01_topic_discovery: PASS** (132 topics visible, all 12 expected
  present). First formal green check — laptop/container/cable/DDS/config
  verified end-to-end. (Restart hygiene notes: container `docker start` +
  3 setup lines; nmcli runtime IP re-add after suspend; robot tmux
  sessions survive laptop reboots.)

### Day 2 continued — tabletop config discovered, resting pose captured

- **Krishna flagged before any motion test: R1 Lite is a TABLETOP bimanual**
  (photo taken) — arms mounted base-up on a flat platform, folded inward,
  grippers facing each other; camera tower between them; torso = parallel-
  linkage lift column; robot TETHERED (charger + ethernet). R1-Pro-style
  "nudge joint 1" is unsafe (horizontal sweep into tower/other arm).
  Motion tests re-ordered: gripper → wrist joint → torso (blocked) →
  chassis (blocked until untethered).
- **Torso launch decoded** (`torso_control_r1_lite.launch.py`): MPC task-space
  controller — v_{x,z,pitch,yaw} limits (0.15/0.15/0.3/0.3) and bounding box
  x∈[±0.45], z∈[0.175,0.72], pitch∈[±1.25], yaw∈[±0.05] (yaw ~locked).
  Internally loads R1's r1_v2_1_0.urdf with robot_model=R1_LITE switch.
  DANGER: if target_joint_state_torso takes task-space values, a naive
  [0,0,0,0] "zero pose" is BELOW z_min → test_06 LOCKED until semantics
  verified. No home pose constant found in the launch file.
- **Resting pose captured (read-only):** arm_left ≈ all-zero, arm_right ≈
  all-zero → **folded tabletop pose IS joint zero**. Torso [−0.002, −0.002,
  0.004, 0.0] → feedback is 4 JOINT angles (not task-space; task z would be
  ≥0.175). Grippers: left 101.8, right 96.0 → **0–100-ish units (percent
  or mm), NOT radians/meters** — differs from R1 Pro catalog (meters).
- Planned first actuation (pending discussion + subscriber probes):
  gripper no-op (target = current) → small close (−15) → back. One DOF,
  cm-scale, clear path.

### Day 2 — FIRST COMMANDED MOTION (gripper) ✅

Command-path probes: target_position_gripper_left consumed by
r1_gripper_controller (+greenwave_monitor watcher); target_joint_state_torso
consumed by **r1_lite_jointTracker_demo_node** (joint-space!) — NOT the MPC.
So two torso paths: joint targets → jointTracker, task-space speeds
(target_speed_torso) → MPC node. Torso joint targets = 4 joint angles
(matching feedback); resting ≈ zeros. control_torso has 2 publishers
(jointTracker + MPC) — command via ONE path only, watch for contention.
All /motion_target subscribers are BEST_EFFORT/VOLATILE QoS.

Gripper sequence (left, empty, hands clear):
1. `--once` publish target=101.8 (no-op): accepted, zero movement. ✓
2. `--once` publish target=85: **NO effect** — controller ignores one-shots.
3. `ros2 topic pub -r 10` streaming target=85: gripper closed smoothly
   101.84 → 87.0, and **stopped the moment the stream stopped** (Ctrl-C at
   ~0.6s, before reaching target). → r1_gripper_controller is a
   follow-the-stream tracker: commands must be CONTINUOUS, dead-man style.
   Same design consequence as R1 Pro: the dimos connection module must
   publish gripper/joint targets every tick, not fire-and-forget.

Chain validated end-to-end: laptop container → DDS multicast over cable →
mobiman gripper controller → HDAS → CAN → motor. First dimos-side actuation
of the R1 Lite.

### Day 2 — ARM COMMAND PATH VALIDATED ✅ (wrist-roll test)

Gripper reopen settled at 100.84 (~1 unit deadband short of 101.8 target —
normal). Then left arm wrist roll (joint 6): streamed target_joint_state_
arm_left at 10 Hz holding joints 1-5 at rest, joint 6 → 0.2 rad. Tracked to
exactly 0.200, other joints unmoved, physical rotation ~11° in place
confirmed; streamed back to 0.001 — home. Same dead-man stream semantics
as the gripper (jointTracker follows while stream lives).

**Hardware validation status:** feedback ✓ (all segments), gripper ✓,
arm joints ✓ — via streamed /motion_target targets, exactly the R1 Pro
pattern minus DOF/unit differences. Remaining: torso (joint path via
jointTracker, tiny delta — planned, not yet run), chassis (BLOCKED until
untethered + clear floor; gating behavior unknown). Every fact needed for
R1LiteConnection is now in hand: 16 upper-body joints (4+6+6), separate
0-100-unit grippers, stream-required command paths, BEST_EFFORT QoS,
domain 2, multicast, topic map reconciled in r1lite_config.py.

### Day 2 — TORSO JOINT-PATH TEST: FAILED SAFE ⚠️ (important negative result)

Precheck: control_torso had NO active publisher (verified on robot via
ros2 topic hz — container can't deserialize hdas_msg custom types; note:
all dimos-facing topics are standard msgs, hdas_msg only on internal
/motion_control layer).

Streamed target_joint_state_torso holding joints 1,2,4 at rest and joint 3
→ +0.05 rad @ 0.3 rad/s. **Robot SHOOK** (motor oscillation), feedback never
tracked (stayed ~0.001). Ctrl-C → shaking stopped instantly (dead-man
confirmed again), torso settled at ~zeros. No damage.

**Diagnosis:** torso is a PARALLELOGRAM lift — joints 1-3 mechanically
coupled. "Move joint 3 alone, hold 1-2" is kinematically unreachable; the
tracker drove motor 3 against the linkage while 1-2 held → oscillation.
Arm test worked because arm joints are serial/independent; torso joints
are not. This is exactly why Galaxea's torso controller is task-space
(x/z/pitch MPC with linkage-aware solver).

**Rules going forward:**
- DO NOT send single-joint deltas to target_joint_state_torso. Any joint-
  space torso command must be a known linkage-consistent tuple (e.g. a
  pose previously read from feedback).
- v1 dimos integration: torso FIXED (mirrors Mustafa deferring R1 Pro
  torso planning). Torso motion later via target_speed_torso task-space
  path (MPC, bounded, linkage-aware) as a separate designed experiment.
- test_06_torso_command.py marked DO-NOT-RUN as written (R1-Pro-style
  joint targets) — needs rewrite to task-space or consistent-tuple form.

Hardware validation final for the session: feedback ✓, gripper ✓, arm ✓,
torso joint-path ✗ (by design of the mechanism, not a bug in our chain),
chassis untested (tethered).

### Day 2 — Official R1 Lite documentation research (web)

Sources: galaxea-dynamics.com product/spec pages, docs.galaxea-ai/dynamics
R1Lite software-introduction + VR-teleop pages (site flaky — content
recovered via search snippets), aifitlab listing.

**Platform identity:** R1 Lite = data-collection/teleop-oriented dual-arm
mobile manipulator, $39,999 base. 23 total DOF = 2×6 (arms) + 3 (torso,
kinematic) + 6 (chassis) + 2 (grippers). 1280×670mm, vertical workspace
0–1.7m. Onboard PC: **Intel i9-12900HK 14-core / 32GB** (matches our
x86_64 finding; the aifitlab "Jetson AGX Orin" claim is wrong for this
model — that's R1/R1 Pro).

**Arms:** Galaxea A1X, 6-DOF, 600mm reach, 4.2 kg each, payload 3 kg
rated @600mm / 5 kg max, ±0.1mm repeatability, max EE speed 5 m/s (!),
spherical wrist.

**Grippers:** Galaxea G1 force-controlled parallel gripper.
**Position range 0–100 CONFIRMED** (VR-teleop config: opening_threshold
80.0/max 100.0, closing 0.0/min 0.0 → 0=closed, 100=open). Our 101.8
reading = fully open w/ slight overtravel. Units resolved.

**Torso (matches our negative result):** official software guide splits
torso control into TWO nodes and warns: torso velocity signals and torso
joint signals "cannot be used together — joint conflicts, safety risk";
**JointTracker starts with disable_torso=true BY DEFAULT** ("users will
not be able to control the torso via target_joint_state_torso").
Our unit shook on joint targets → its boot config evidently enables it
(or partially) — worth checking start_r1_lite_jointTrackerdemo_fast.sh
args someday, but v1 plan stands: torso FIXED, task-space path later
(v_x ±0.1 m/s, v_z ±0.1 m/s, w_pitch/w_yaw 0.3 rad/s of torso_link3 rel
base_link, right-hand rule).

**Chassis:** 3 self-developed steering-wheel (swerve) modules = 6 DOF,
360° omni, modes translation/spin/Ackermann, max 1.5 m/s; control node
takes vector commands x, y, w simultaneously. → our chassis test =
target_speed_chassis TwistStamped with tiny vx, no gatekeeper needed
per docs (R1 Pro's 3-gate saga may be W1/R1Pro-specific — still verify).

**Head:** pure binocular RGB stereo (no depth) ✓. Wrist: D405 depth cams ✓
(WC1 option fitted on our unit).

### Day 2 — CHASSIS MYSTERY SOLVED: RC mode map (no bypass needed!)

Chassis node (`chassis_type: new_W1` — same W1 family as R1 Pro) subscribes
/controller and vetoes software unless the RC grants mode 5. Krishna mapped
the RC empirically (4 switches: sw1/sw4 two-position, sw2/sw3 three-position):

| Switch combo | mode | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| all switches position 1 | **5** | SOFTWARE/AUTO — external cmds may drive (the value Mustafa's gatekeeper faked!) |
| sw1@2 + sw2@3 | 2 | brake/lock (matches R1 Pro mode-2 braking) |
| sw1@2 + sw2@3 + sw3@mid | **3** | RC MANUAL — sticks drive (RC-driving validated live!) |
| other single flips | 255 | invalid combo |
| RC OFF | 3 | receiver failsafe = "manual, sticks centered" → chassis obediently parked, software vetoed |

Explains everything: all "chassis dead" symptoms (0.3mm/s creep with gates
streamed, RC "not working") were the RC being off/in manual with no stick
input. The R1 Pro bypass (launch remap + fake mode=5) is NOT needed on this
unit — RC ON + all-switches-position-1 = legitimate mode 5, and the RC
remains a live takeover/brake layer (flip sw1 = revoke software control).
NO robot files were modified. Procedure for software chassis control:
RC ON, mode 5 verified via /controller, then stream gates+speed (test_03).

### Day 2 (late) — THE CHASSIS SAGA: unresolved, fully mapped ⏸️

Chronology of the wheels-won't-turn hunt (all hypotheses tested and killed):
1. Software cmds produced 0.3mm/s creep → suspected R1 Pro 3-gate problem.
2. Streamed acc_limit + brake=false + Gate-1 subscriber (4-shell test, then
   test_03 rewritten to do all gates itself): still creep.
3. Discovered RC mode map (see earlier entry); RC manual (mode 3) DROVE the
   robot — motors/VCU proven working at that moment.
4. Mode 5 verified + all gates streamed: STILL creep. Chassis pane logs
   (tmux capture) showed `target_speed_command 0.05` AND
   `last_send_speed_command 0.05` — node accepts targets, ramp reaches
   full speed, publishes motor commands. Every software gate open.
5. /motion_control/control_chassis capture: v_des=[0.05×3] on wheels but
   **`mode: 0`** in every MotorControl msg — suspicious but unconfirmed
   (never captured a working-drive reference for comparison).
6. **Chassis node LATCHES last target forever — NO staleness timeout**
   (kept publishing v_des=0.05 minutes after stream stopped). RULE: always
   end chassis sessions with a zero-stream. (Arm tracker does have
   dead-man behavior; chassis does not!)
7. Later in the same boot, RC manual STOPPED driving too. Eliminated: RC
   (all 4 axes sweep 240-1807, link healthy), e-stop (released, no error),
   VCU faults (w1-w6 all zero), battery (54V, 99.9%!), stack state (fresh
   restart), brake/acc streams during RC manual. NOTHING moves the wheels.
8. My missteps logged honestly: premature "DDS corruption" call (was my
   own `ros2 daemon stop` + short timeouts emptying the CLI cache —
   container discovery direct via rclpy was always fine); proposed
   Mustafa-bypass (remap+fake mode) would NOT have helped (mode gate
   provably open — ramp ran).
9. **Lead for next session:** Galaxea unboxing docs say R1 Lite ships with
   THREE remotes: torso, chassis, and a separate WIRELESS E-STOP remote
   ("software-based switch halting all operations"). We never checked it —
   a pressed/dead e-stop fob (failsafe = STOP) would explain everything
   incl. "worked earlier, died mid-session". CHECK THE E-STOP REMOTE FIRST.
   Also in docs: "Wheel Motor Zero-Point Calibration Instruction" exists;
   support: product@galaxea-dynamics.com.

Session totals: gripper ✅ arm ✅ torso ⚠️(negative result, guarded)
chassis ⏸️(node-level fully validated; wheel-level refusal unresolved).

## 2026-07-09 — Day 3: CHASSIS SOLVED ✅ (test_03 PASS)

Structured fault-tree session (planned before touching hardware). Key
discriminating experiments and results:

1. **No wireless e-stop fob exists on this unit** (only the base button) —
   suspect C eliminated by inventory.
2. **Clean cold boot** (both e-stops clear, RC in manual BEFORE power-on):
   **RC manual drove the robot WITH NO ROS STACK RUNNING** → RC-manual is
   VCU-DIRECT (radio → VCU firmware). The ROS chassis node was never in
   the manual loop.
3. Reference capture during RC driving: /motion_control/control_chassis
   carried ALL ZEROS while wheels turned — confirms bypass conclusively.
4. Arm reference during working software motion (test_04 PASS):
   control_arm_left shows mode: 0 TOO → **mode field acquitted** (0 does
   not mean "don't execute"). Real arm/chassis frame difference: arms carry
   full impedance params (kp/kd/t_ff), chassis frames have empty arrays —
   turned out to be irrelevant.
5. **THE ANSWER: test_03 on a healthy VCU simply PASSED.** Peak measured
   0.0470 m/s, stop to 0.0000, ~5cm roll, RC in mode 5, all gates streamed
   by the script. Nothing was ever wrong with the software recipe.

**Root cause of the entire Day-2 chassis saga: the VCU was latched**
(e-stop pressed at/before a power-on earlier that day). A latched VCU:
- ignores software chassis commands (the eternal 0.3mm/s "creep")
- eventually also killed RC manual mid-session
- survives ROS stack restarts, reports w1-w6 error_code 0, clears ONLY on
  a clean power cycle with e-stops released
Every Day-2 software experiment ran on poisoned hardware; the recipe
(RC ON mode 5 + Gate-1 subscriber + acc_limit + brake=false + streamed
speed) was correct all along.

**Final chassis operating procedure:** cold-boot with e-stops released →
RC ON, all switches position 1 (mode 5) → test_03 or equivalent gate
streams → drive. End every session with a zero-stream (latch!). If wheels
ever refuse both paths: power cycle, don't debug software.

**Day-3 addendum:** test_03 re-run twice more — PASS both (peaks 0.0490 /
0.0447 m/s, stops to 0.0000). Chassis validation is reproducible. Curiosity
left open (academic): a 40s capture of /motion_control/control_chassis
during the passing runs again showed all-zero v_des — either timing missed
the 1s moves, or software wheel commands route below/beside that topic
just like RC manual does. Irrelevant to the integration (our interface is
/motion_target/*, proven working); logged for completeness.
BRING-UP PHASE COMPLETE — next: R1LiteConnection module.

**Day-3 correction (routing curiosity CLOSED):** synchronized rclpy
recording (both topics, domain 2, 3671 msgs each) during two more test_03
PASSes shows /motion_control/control_chassis DOES carry the wheel commands:
v_des ramps 0.03→0.05 on the three drive wheels one second before measured
motion appears. Plumbing is exactly as documented (node → control_chassis
→ HDAS → CAN → VCU); mode:0 + empty kp/kd are normal for velocity-mode
wheels. All earlier "all-zeros during software drive" captures were tooling
failures, NOT hidden routing. The RC-manual-bypasses-ROS conclusion stands
(that capture was valid and received messages fine).
Tooling lesson for the record: non-interactive SSH does not source
~/.bashrc → any remote ros2/rclpy one-liner MUST set ROS_DOMAIN_ID=2
explicitly, and robot-side `ros2` CLI depends on a flaky daemon — prefer
direct rclpy via python3 heredoc for instrumentation.

## 2026-07-09 (later) — R1LiteConnection LIVE: runs 1 & 2 PASS ✅

**R1LiteConnection module + r1lite-coordinator / r1lite-keyboard-teleop
blueprints written** (mirroring R1ProConnection; torso commands dropped,
grippers first-class, chassis dead-man streaming, validated acc limits).
Registered in all_blueprints. Venv had regressed to py3.12 (host Booster
work re-synced it — bind-mount see-saw); rebuilt py3.10.

**Run 1 (coordinator, hardware):** all 25 transports up, feedback found
instantly, coordinator ticked 100Hz streaming hold-position to the arms —
**arms perfectly still for 40s** (bootstrap gate + hold-current-pose
verified on hardware). Fixed a teardown race found in the log (publish
loop vs dying ROS context — loop now joins before courtesy chassis-zero).

**Run 2 (cameras in rerun):** left wrist + right wrist + head streaming
live in the two-tab layout, ~1.2 GiB/10s, smooth. Verified end-to-end:
ROS compressed → connection decode → LCM → rerun bridge → viewer.

**The viewer saga (write-off of ~45 min):**
- `dimos run` is NEVER headless: global_config default viewer="rerun" —
  the bridge always composes. True headless = `--viewer none`.
- Native viewer in container: X11 auth fail; after `xhost +local:` it
  crashed anyway (software-GL/winit BadDrawable — rerun-in-docker is
  unsupported). Container GUIs: don't.
- rerun-web mode: hung worker 0 mid-start (R1LiteConnection never finished
  starting — cohabits worker 0 with the bridge), only grpc :9876 up, :9090
  never served; ugly force-kill shutdowns. Isolated probe of
  serve_web_viewer() worked — suspicion: first-use asset fetch blocking
  worker 0. (My "rerun-web-viewer package missing" theory was WRONG —
  invented package name; assets ship in rerun-sdk.)
- **WINNING SETUP: viewer on the laptop + connect mode.** Host venv is
  container-built (py3.10 shebangs → not executable on host), so:
  `uv tool install rerun-sdk==0.29.2` on the host, `rerun --port 9877`,
  and in the container VIEWER=rerun-connect (global_config reads env
  vars). Host networking makes 127.0.0.1:9877 shared. Clean shutdowns.
- One-command launcher added: `scripts/r1lite_test/run_r1lite.sh`
  (starts host viewer if needed, starts container, runs blueprint with
  VIEWER=rerun-connect).

Remaining for blueprint validation: run 3 = r1lite-keyboard-teleop
(chassis via full dimos chain; RC mode 5 + staging).

**RUN 3: PASS — r1lite-keyboard-teleop drove the robot.** All six keys
functional (W/S fore-aft, A/D rotate, Q/E strafe — swerve crab confirmed),
release = stop (module dead-man), Ctrl-C = clean elegant shutdown incl.
courtesy chassis-zero guard. Launched via run_r1lite.sh one-command flow.
QoS note: drove even with the BEST_EFFORT publishers — the starved
RELIABLE subscriber on target_speed_chassis is a monitor, not the chassis
controller; publishers switched to RELIABLE anyway (serves both kinds).

**RUNTIME LAYER COMPLETE (2026-07-09):** R1LiteConnection + coordinator +
keyboard teleop are hardware-validated end to end — feedback, arms-hold,
cameras-to-viewer, chassis driving. Remaining for the PR: r1_lite
description package (URDF+meshes to LFS) + catalog factory, distilled
docs/README, CI gate, rebase story vs Mustafa's branch/main.

**Untethered driving (question raised, analyzed, parked):** RC manual —
yes anytime (radio→VCU). dimos over office WiFi — expected NO: DDS
discovery needs multicast and the office AP kills it (same IGMP-snooping
behavior that broke Go2 discovery); robot nodes also aren't registered
with any discovery server, so no unicast rendezvous either. Paths if
needed later: (1) 2-min empirical test (unplug cable, ros2 topic list
over WiFi), (2) Galaxea's official WiFi mode = findrobot_server.sh
discovery-server switch (invasive: rewrites robot bashrc + reboots — a
deliberate migration), (3) RECOMMENDED: dedicated travel router bridged
to the robot's ethernet, Go2-style — nothing on the robot changes.
Cameras over WiFi would strain regardless (--viewer none when wireless).

### Day 3 — rerun-web ROOT-CAUSED via py-spy (dimos-core bug, not ours)

Retried `--viewer rerun-web` deliberately (connect-mode workflow untouched).
Reproduced exactly: grpc :9876 up, :9090 never serves, R1LiteConnection
start stalls mid-sequence, shutdown wedges. py-spy dump of the live hung
worker 0 (pid 3920) shows the smoking gun:

- Bridge thread: `bridge.py:329 start` → `rerun/sinks.py:372 serve_grpc`
  — **active+gil**: spinning inside rr.serve_grpc() WITHOUT releasing the
  GIL; never reaches serve_web_viewer (so :9090 never opens).
- Connection thread: `_setup_sensor_streams` → `Thread.start()` →
  `threading.wait` — waiting for its new thread's started-event, which
  can never fire because the GIL is hogged. Every Python thread in the
  worker starves → "R1LiteConnection started" never logs, teardown hangs.

Isolated probe (fresh python, same venv, same calls) returns instantly →
the deadlock is specific to rerun 0.29.2 serve_grpc() inside dimos'
multiprocessing **forkserver** worker children (rust/tokio state vs fork,
classic). Affects ANY robot blueprint using web mode in-container; native
(rr.spawn) and connect (rr.connect_grpc) paths don't hit it.

**Resolution: rerun-web marked known-broken; rerun-connect stays the
workflow (run_r1lite.sh). Evidence package ready for a dimos-core issue:**
repro = any blueprint w/ RerunBridge viewer_mode=web in a worker; py-spy
dump as above; suggested fix directions = call serve_grpc off the worker
hot path / spawn-context workers / rerun version bump.

**rerun-web WORKAROUND VALIDATED (sidecar pattern):** in-container
`rerun --serve-web --port 9877` (headless — no X11 needed) + blueprint in
VIEWER=rerun-connect → browser at
http://127.0.0.1:9090?url=rerun%2Bhttp%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A9877%2Fproxy
shows all cameras live; R1LiteConnection starts cleanly (rust server in
its own process = fork can't poison it — confirms the root-cause theory).
Gotchas: plain :9090 without the ?url= param = empty viewer (must use the
full URL the sidecar prints); add --memory-limit 2GB or the sidecar
buffers history until RAM (hit 1GiB in 38s of cameras).
run_r1lite.sh now has --web mode implementing this. Proper core fix
proposal stands: bridge.py web mode should spawn the server subprocess +
connect_grpc instead of in-process serve_grpc.

---

# Day 4 — 2026-07-17: onboard install executed end-to-end (PASS)

First real execution of `r1lite_dimos_install.sh` on the robot. Everything
below is a bug the flow shipped with and nobody could have found by reading
it: each one only exists because the robot's environment differs from the
laptop's. All fixed and pushed the same session.

**Result: dimos runs ON the R1 Lite.** `r1lite-coordinator` up, 16 joints +
chassis registered, TickLoop 100Hz, 6 camera streams bridged, browser viewer
on the laptop showing live wrist/head cameras. DDS gauntlet: 1344 msgs/8s.

## 1. Image transfer: the printed command ate its own stdin
`docker save … | ssh r1lite "echo 1 | sudo -S docker load"` → *unrecognized
image format*, instantly. `echo 1 |` feeds SUDO's stdin, which `docker load`
inherits — so load read the literal "1", and the 15GB stream went nowhere.
Fix: `docker save … | ssh r1lite "docker load"` (docker group is active after
a re-login anyway). NEVER pipe a password into a command whose stdin is data.

## 2. Step-8 import check: `docker exec bash -c` does not read .bashrc
`import rclpy` → ModuleNotFoundError. The check sourced the venv but not ROS;
the image's .bashrc (which sources Humble) is skipped by non-interactive,
non-login shells. Same root cause bit the rerun sidecar (below).

## 3. **DDS: root container cannot RECEIVE via shared memory (the big one)**
Symptom: `feedback_arm_left msgs in 8s: 0`, but `ros2 topic list` inside the
container showed all 67 /hdas topics. Host `ros2 topic hz` = 199.96Hz.
The classic "topics visible, zero messages" — and our documented cause
(**/dev/shm not shared**) was WRONG. Verified /dev/shm IS shared: a file
written on the host was readable in the container, and both saw the same 106
`fastrtps_*` segments.

Real cause: FastDDS delivers same-host data by writing into the READER's
/dev/shm segment. Vendor stack runs as `r1lite` (uid 1000); segments are
`-rw-r--r-- r1lite r1lite`. Our container runs as **root**, so the segments IT
creates are root-owned — and the vendor's uid-1000 publishers cannot write
into them. Discovery is UDP (works); data delivery dies silently, no error.

Two fixes, both hardware-verified at 200Hz on /hdas/feedback_arm_left:
1. `docker exec --user 1000:1000` → SHM works (keeps zero-copy).
2. FastDDS profile with `useBuiltinTransports=false` + UDPv4 only → root-safe
   and uid-agnostic. Committed as `fastdds_udp_only.xml`; run_r1lite.sh and
   the installer's step-8 apply it automatically when ON_ROBOT.
Chosen for the dev flow: (2) — the dev container is root and X11/teleop is
wired to /root. For the production image: (1), via compose `user:`, so future
pointcloud payloads keep SHM.

## 4. rerun sidecar: `executable file not found in $PATH`
`docker exec -d $CONTAINER rerun --serve-web` — rerun exists ONLY at
`/app/.venv/bin/rerun`; non-login shell → no venv on PATH. Fixed to the full
path. (Same family as #2.)

## 5. dimos' LCM configurator needs host network settings it cannot apply
`ip route add 224.0.0.0/4 dev lo` → *RTNETLINK answers: Operation not
permitted*: containers have no CAP_NET_ADMIN. With `--network host` the route
belongs to the HOST anyway → installer now runs, on the host:
    sudo ip link set lo multicast on
    sudo ip route add 224.0.0.0/4 dev lo
**Neither persists across reboot** (sysctls do; `ip` state does not) — the
installer re-applies them every run. The production setup.sh must persist them
(systemd oneshot / networkd drop-in) or the first customer reboot silently
kills the LCM bus and dimos prompts for a sudo it cannot use.

## Other observations
- Galaxea stack does NOT autostart on power-on: after a reboot `tmux ls` was
  empty. roslaunch.sh boots it; the runtime image's entrypoint waits for
  /hdas/* so container start order never matters.
- Robot's `.bashrc`: `ROS_DOMAIN_ID=02`; a `FASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE`
  pointing at `/opt/galaxea/find_server/super_client_configuration_file.xml`
  is present but **commented out** — vendor discovery is plain multicast.
- 3D pane in the viewer is empty: r1lite URDF/meshes are not in the repo yet
  (pending PR item). Cameras/joints are unaffected.
- Laptop docker 29.6 uses the containerd image store → `docker save` emits an
  OCI archive; robot docker 29.1.3 loaded it without complaint.

## Day 4 (cont.) — full test suite re-run ONBOARD: all PASS, + RC mode map extended

All tests run from the robot's own container (not the laptop), with
`FASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE=/app/scripts/r1lite_test/fastdds_udp_only.xml`:

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| test_00 recon / test_01 topics / test_02 arm feedback | PASS |
| test_04 arm wrist roll | **PASS** — `wrist at +0.236 (target +0.236)`, returned `+0.036 (home +0.036)` |
| test_03 chassis | FAIL → **PASS** after RC → mode 5 |

### The chassis FAIL was our own docstring
First run: `Peak measured speed during move: 0.0003 m/s` — the exact 0.3mm/s
creep of the Day-2 saga. But the VCU was NOT latched. `test_03`'s header and
safety prompt said **"RC idle/off"** — written before the Day-2 RC mode map and
never corrected. RC OFF is the one state that guarantees a veto.
Fixed in `82f87e0af` (header + prompt now demand RC ON / all switches pos 1 and
show the verify command, with the history inline so it isn't "cleaned up").

### RC mode map — new data point, Day-2 entry was situational
Measured this session on `/controller`:

| RC state | mode | axes | Day-2 note |
|---|---|---|---|
| **RC OFF** | **0** | 0.0 | Day 2 recorded **3** ("receiver failsafe") — so RC-off is NOT always 3. |
| RC ON, manual combo (sw1@2+sw2@3+sw3@mid) | 3 | 1024.0 (centered) | matches |
| RC ON, all switches position 1 | 5 | — | matches; test_03 then PASSED |

Take the map as *indicative*; the reliable rule is **verify `mode: 5` before
blaming anything else**. Plausible reading: 3 = bound receiver failing safe with
the transmitter off; 0 = no controller signal at all. Not worth resolving —
the operational rule is unaffected.

### Diagnostic that separates veto from latched VCU in seconds
Veto (mode≠5) and latched VCU produce the **identical** 0.3mm/s creep — this is
what cost Day 2 an entire day. They are trivially distinguishable:
1. `ros2 topic echo /controller --once` → mode≠5 ⇒ veto, fix the RC, done.
2. **Does RC manual drive the wheels?** Yes ⇒ VCU healthy (a latched VCU
   eventually kills RC manual too). Confirmed live this session: manual drove.
3. mode 5 + still creeping + RC manual dead ⇒ latched VCU ⇒ power cycle.

### `hdas_msg` does not exist in our container
`ros2 topic echo /controller` inside the container:
`The message type 'hdas_msg/msg/ControllerSignalStamped' is invalid`.
Vendor custom types live only in the Galaxea workspace. Echo them from the HOST:
```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash && source ~/galaxea/install/setup.bash
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=2 && ros2 topic echo /controller --once
```
(dimos itself is unaffected — it defines its own message classes and reads
/hdas/* fine; it is only the ROS **CLI** inside the container that can't decode
vendor types.)

# Day 5 — 2026-07-16/17: clean branch off main + RUNTIME image deployed onboard

Two goals: a merge-ready branch on current `main` (the old branch was 274
commits behind and based on Mustafa's r1pro branch, not main), and the FIRST
execution of the *runtime* deployment path (`scripts/galaxea/`: versioned
image + compose + `/opt/dimos`) as opposed to the dev path (bind-mounted
checkout + venv) that Day 4 validated.

**Result: both done.** `krishna/task/r1lite-integration-v2` off current main,
hardware-validated. dimos runs onboard from an immutable image, `Up (healthy)`,
DDS gauntlet **1600 msgs/8s**, live camera feed with no perceptible lag.

The theme of the day: **every bug was something declared but never verified.**
A permissive dev environment (`uv sync --all-extras` + `default-groups =
["tests"]`) is a superset that hides every violation of the contract dimos
publishes. The runtime image is the first thing that ever took that contract
literally, so it found four years of drift in one session.

## 1. Port mechanism: content-port, not cherry-pick

41 commits, ~11 of them Mustafa's r1pro base. No clean subset to pick: single
commits mixed both robots (`all_blueprints.py`, `pyproject.toml`). Branched off
`origin/main`, `git checkout <old-branch> -- <r1lite paths>`, regenerated
`uv.lock`, recommitted as logical commits. R1 Lite verified independent of
r1pro (only docstring references) and `catalog/galaxea.py` is pure r1pro and
imported by nothing — dropped.

**Cherry-pick would have given FALSE confidence**: r1lite is ~95% new files and
new files never conflict, so a pick reports "clean" while the code is stale
against 274 commits of drift. Proven immediately — `_resolve_viewer_mode` no
longer exists on main and both blueprints failed to import. Only tests catch
this class; git cannot.

## 2. **Python 3.10 is broken on main — three separate packages**

pyproject declares `requires-python = ">=3.10,<3.13"`, ROS 2 Humble's rclpy is
cp310, and **nothing in CI ever builds a 3.10 venv**. So it rots:

| package | failure |
|---|---|
| `onnxruntime` / `onnxruntime-gpu` | unbounded → 1.24+ dropped cp310 wheels |
| `a750-control` | single cp312-only wheel, no python marker |
| `gtsam-extended` | only cp310 wheel is macOS-arm64; linux is cp311/312 |

All three bounded/markered. `gtsam` is NOT opt-out-able: `unitree` depends on
`dimos[base,mapping]`, so `--no-extra mapping` is a no-op (tried; still failed).

Scanned the whole lock across BOTH axes (python tag AND platform tag, honouring
abi3 + sdist fallback) — these were the only real hits; `pywin32` is win32-gated.

## 3. Viewer API drift (three instances of one flip)

rerun 0.29 → 0.32 inverted the model: the **viewer used to listen** on 9877 and
dimos connected to it; now **dimos serves** and viewers connect.

- `_resolve_viewer_mode` deleted from `bridge.py` → blueprints unimportable.
  Fix: `vis_module(global_config.viewer, ...)`, the current house idiom — which
  also composes `RerunWebSocketServer` (the WASD panel's receiver).
- `ViewerBackend` collapsed to `rerun|none`; `rerun-connect`/`rerun-web` are
  gone. `GlobalConfig` is pydantic, so a stale `VIEWER=rerun-connect` does not
  degrade — it **raises at startup**. `run_r1lite.sh` and the onboard
  `setup.sh` both still exported it: dead on arrival. Now `VIEWER=rerun` +
  `RERUN_OPEN=none`.
- compose's viewer sidecar ran `rerun --serve-web --port 9877` — still the 0.29
  model — so it fought dimos for 9877 and crash-looped. Its unused proxy moved
  to 9878; it exists only to host the web app on 9090.

## 4. X11: the cookie is keyed by (hostname, display)

`dimos run r1lite-keyboard-teleop` → `Authorization required, but no
authorization protocol specified` → `pygame.error: x11 not available`. SDL
reports an auth failure as a capability failure; the real error is the line
above.

Mounting `~/.Xauthority` is necessary but NOT sufficient: under docker's default
hostname the cookie inside is addressed to a different host, the lookup misses,
and no credentials are sent. Fix: `--hostname "$(hostname)"`. Both creation
paths were broken differently — `run_r1lite.sh` never mounted the cookie at all;
the installer mounted it but not the hostname (so `ssh -X` teleop would fail
onboard). Escape hatch for existing containers: `xhost +local:`.

## 5. **The image was non-reproducible and shipped untested software**

`pip install dimos-*.whl` resolves dependencies itself: it ignores `uv.lock` AND
pyproject's deliberate `exclude-newer = "7 days"`. It took latest-wins and
installed **typer 0.27.0** against a lock pinning **0.23.1**. typer 0.27 changed
annotation introspection; dimos builds its CLI options from GlobalConfig's
`Literal` fields, so **every** dimos command in the image died:

    TypeError: issubclass() arg 1 must be a class

The dev venv never saw it — uv honours the lock. **The deeper bug: building the
same commit twice on different days produced different software**, which makes
the immutable-tag rollback promise a lie.

Fix: export the lock in the builder, install with `uv pip install --no-deps`.
Three details, each found by a failed build:
- **`--no-default-groups`, not `--no-dev`**: `default-groups = ["tests"]` means
  `--no-dev` still exports the whole test suite (torch/mujoco/ultralytics) and
  fails outright on `pyaudio` (no linux wheel; wants portaudio.h + a compiler).
  **149 packages, not 377.**
- **uv, not pip**: the export carries hashes → pip enters `--require-hashes`,
  where every requirement must be `==`-pinned; transitive extras are not
  (`chromadb` wants `uvicorn[standard]>=0.18.3`) → pip aborts.
- **`--no-deps`, not resolving**: pyproject uses `override-dependencies` to
  force versions past what packages declare (moondream pins pillow<11; the lock
  ships pillow 12). Those overrides are not in the exported file, so a resolver
  rediscovers a conflict the lock already settled.

## 6. **Four undeclared imports: `pip install dimos` cannot run vis_module**

`vis_module` imports `WebsocketVisModule` unconditionally (every viewer setting,
including `none`, composes it) and that module imports `socketio`, `starlette`
and `uvicorn` at module scope. In pyproject: `python-socketio` was in the
**`lint` group** (mypy stubs), `starlette` **nowhere** (arrived via fastapi),
`uvicorn` in the **`web` extra**, `websockets` **nowhere**.

So a core-only install cannot run **any** blueprint using `vis_module` —
go2-basic, drone-basic, the G1 nav set, r1lite. **Not an R1 Lite bug.** Nobody
had ever installed dimos the way it ships. All four declared in core.

Found by deploying to the robot, where it restart-looped. Then confirmed the
rest by AST-walking the import graph (including function-level imports) against
the core export.

## 7. The smoke test that wasn't

`RUN dimos list | grep -q r1lite-coordinator` passed on an image whose blueprint
could not import — `list` only reads registry **strings**, it never imports a
blueprint. It caught the typer breakage and nothing else.

Now the build imports both r1lite blueprints, i.e. the real graph the robot
runs. That is what would have caught socketio at build time. It works: the next
build **failed**, so no broken image was produced. Also moved below `USER dimos`
so it proves the runtime user can write `$HOME/.local/state/dimos`.

## 8. Production hardening (before first fleet use)

Three of these are the same mistake in different layers — we pinned the thing we
were looking at and left the thing underneath floating:

| fix | why |
|---|---|
| base pinned by **digest** | `ros:humble-ros-base-jammy` is mutable and rebuilt regularly; we pinned 149 python deps then built them on a shifting OS |
| **`user: 1000`** | see §9 — a data-loss bug, not hygiene |
| **`stop_grace_period: 30s`** | VCU latches its last velocity; SIGTERM triggers the courtesy zero, docker SIGKILLs at 10s, and a killed process sends no zero → **robot keeps driving** |
| log rotation | json-file is unbounded; a 100Hz robot fills its disk weeks later at a customer site |
| healthcheck (TCP 7779) | `restart: unless-stopped` only catches processes that EXIT, never wedged-but-alive |
| `.env` prefers **digest** over tag | tags are mutable; "rollback to known-good" silently gets different bytes |

Healthcheck is a TCP connect, deliberately **not** an HTTP GET: `/` redirects to
`/command-center`, which 503s unless the React app was built (it isn't, in this
image) — an HTTP probe would report healthy robots as unhealthy.

## 9. **SHM/uid: SOLVED — `ipc: host` + `user: 1000` → 1600 msgs/8s** ✅

Day 4 (§3) found root containers cannot receive via shared memory and worked
around it with a UDP-only FastDDS profile — **at the cost of zero-copy**. The
runtime path fixes it properly instead: run the container as the vendor's own
uid.

- `ipc: host` alone is **necessary but NOT sufficient** — sharing `/dev/shm`
  doesn't help if our reader segments are root-owned and uid-1000 publishers
  can't write them.
- `user: "${DIMOS_UID:-1000}:${DIMOS_GID:-1000}"`, with `setup.sh` writing
  `id -u`/`id -g` — correct by construction on a robot shipping a different uid.

**Result: 1483 then 1600 msgs/8s (~185Hz = full rate), zero-copy intact.** No
UDP-only profile needed on the runtime path.

## 10. A stale dev container silently owned 9877 for 8 hours

`dimos-dev-r1lite` (the Day-4 dev path) was still up, holding 9877 and 9090. So
**dimos never bound 9877 while reporting `healthy`** — the healthcheck probes
7779 (WebsocketVisModule), not rerun. A laptop viewer connecting to the robot
would have rendered last week's code with no way to tell.

Lessons: **the dev path and the runtime path must not both run on a robot**, and
a green healthcheck proves the process is up, not that the bridge is serving.

## 11. Camera latency 45s → live. **The network was never the problem.**

Symptom: a connected viewer reported `Latency: 45.3 s` and **6.2 GiB after
1m44s** (~60 MB/s), replaying the past instead of showing the present.

- **Hypothesis (WRONG): the robot→laptop DDS hop is saturated by raw depth.**
  Prediction: running dimos onboard fixes it.
- **Test:** deployed onboard. **Latency got WORSE: 15s → 45s.**
- **Conclusion:** onboard took the heavy traffic OFF DDS and put it ON the rerun
  stream, which now crosses the network instead. The bottleneck was always the
  rerun path.

Two causes, both defaults nobody had revisited:
1. `R1LiteConnection._compressed_decode_loop` runs `cv2.imdecode` on the robot's
   `/compressed` topics and republishes **raw BGR** — so the bridge logs six
   *uncompressed* streams (4 colour + 2 16-bit depth). r1lite passed **no
   `max_hz`**, so every frame of all six went to the viewer.
2. The bridge's gRPC proxy buffers history for late-connecting viewers, default
   **`memory_limit = "25%"`** — a quarter of the robot's RAM. That is the 6.2 GiB
   a fresh viewer inherits and must chew through before reaching live.

Fix: per-entity `max_hz` (head-left 10Hz — the driving view; stereo partner and
depth 2Hz; wrists 5Hz) + `memory_limit: "1GB"`. **60 MB/s → ~31 MB/s, latency
indicator gone (rerun only draws it when behind), live hand motion in all
panels.**

Still open: we ship raw BGR at all. The robot had JPEG and we throw it away.
Keeping frames compressed for transport is the real fix (a change to
`R1LiteConnection`, not a knob) if more cameras / higher rates / WiFi are ever
wanted.

## Open

- Runtime image not published to a registry → the laptop is still in the loop
  (`docker save | scp`). Publishing to ghcr (ideally from CI on merge) is what
  makes a blank robot `git clone && setup.sh`.
- WASD panel still doesn't drive: `RerunWebSocketServer` is composed, but
  `tele_cmd_vel` → `/cmd_vel` is unwired. Needs the panel's baked-in speed
  measured first (it is not tunable from Python).
- **No CI builds the 3.10 floor or a core-only install.** Four of today's bug
  classes would have been caught by one job: install core-only on 3.10, import
  every blueprint. Worth filing on its own merit.
