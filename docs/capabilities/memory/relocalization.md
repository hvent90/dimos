# Relocalization

This walkthrough shows the pre-map capabilities, including how to record,
export a premap from a mem2 `.db`, and run the robot with relocalization
enabled. You can also navigate to a place the robot hasn't visited during
this run, as long as it's part of the global map.

## 1. Install

Follow the platform guide for your machine:

- [docs/installation/ubuntu.md](../../installation/ubuntu.md)
- [docs/installation/nix.md](../../installation/nix.md)
- [docs/installation/osx.md](../../installation/osx.md)

If you cloned this branch directly (rather than installing a release), use
these commands (refer to Developing on DimOS section in install docs):

```bash
# Ubuntu, macOS
uv sync --all-groups
# or Nix
pip install -e ".[misc,sim,visualization,agents,web,perception,unitree,manipulation,cpu]"
```

## 2. Record a run

```bash
dimos --robot-ip {YOUR_ROBOT_IP} run unitree-go2-memory
```

If `DIMOS_ROBOT_IP` is set in your environment (or `.env`), you can drop
the `--robot-ip` flag:

```bash
dimos run unitree-go2-memory
```

This writes `recording_go2.db` to the repo root.

Move it into `data/` and rename it after the place you scanned (e.g.
`go2_hongkong_office.db`) so the export tool can resolve it by name and
your premap ends up with a useful filename:

```bash
mv recording_go2.db data/{DB_NAME}.db
```

`{DB_NAME}` is the stem (no `.db`); the next steps refer to it.

## 3. Export the premap

Convert the recording to a relocalization premap (`.pc2.lcm`). If you
kept the default recording filename:

```bash
dimos export-premap recording_go2
```

Otherwise pass the name of the `.db` you produced:

```bash
dimos export-premap {DB_NAME}
```

Sample log:

```
computing twopass map from /Users/dimos/Desktop/dimos-reloc/data/go2_hongkong_office_2.db (voxel_size=0.05)...
  Pass 1: 908 frames, 1 keyframes
12:54:32.025[inf][dimos/mapping/voxels.py       ] VoxelGrid using device: CPU:0
wrote /Users/dimos/Desktop/dimos-reloc/data/go2_hongkong_office_2_twopass_map.pc2.lcm
```

The output filename is `{DB_NAME}_twopass_map.pc2.lcm`, stored in `data/`.

## 4. Relocalize against the premap (replay smoke test)

Replay the same recording and have the relocalization module localize
against the premap you just exported:

```bash
dimos --replay --replay-db {DB_NAME} run unitree-go2 \
  -o relocalizationmodule.map_file={DB_NAME}_twopass_map
```

Sample log:

```
12:58:51.469[inf][imos/mapping/relocalization.py] Relocalization module started: map_file='go2_hongkong_office_2_twopass_map'  loaded_map.frame_id='map'  placeholder TF 'world' -> 'map'  z_offset=20.0

```

`relocalize skipped` means the live submap is still warming up (fewer
than `MIN_LOCAL_POINTS` points). `relocalize rejected` means a candidate
was found but its fitness was below the configured threshold (default
`0.6`). If you want to see every candidate accepted regardless of
quality, disable the gate:

```bash
-o relocalizationmodule.fitness_threshold=0.0
```

You can watch the alignment in Rerun. The loaded premap is published on
its own entity — to compare the merged costmap (live scan + premap)
against the live scan alone, click the eye icon next to the loaded-map
entity to toggle it off.

![toggle loaded map](assets/reloc_hide_loaded_map.png)

With the loaded map hidden you see the partial pointcloud from the
scanning replay plus the full costmap from the merged current scan +
premap.

Also, you can also replay a different recording taken in the same physical
space against the same premap.


## 5. Relocalize on a live robot

Same flags as the replay test, but point at the live robot instead of a
recorded `.db`:

```bash
dimos --robot-ip {YOUR_ROBOT_IP} run unitree-go2 \
  -o relocalizationmodule.map_file={DB_NAME}_twopass_map
```
